# Standup Meeting Notes Template
    Place general meeting agenda here with what the overall meeting will be about. Keep it brief and simple.

## Member's Present

    Make sure to check on who is able to make it to the standup meetings(preferably everyone) and make a list to show who is present at each meeting.
    Example:
        - [x] Member 1
        - [x] Member 2
        - [ ] Member 3
        - [x] Member 4
        - [ ] Member 5
        - [ ] Member 6
        - [x] Member 7
        - [x] Member 8
        - [x] Member 9
    Some form of this will suffice.
