                <h1 id="top">James's Three Day Journal</h1>
                <p>This page will contain the desciptions of my past three days in all of its excitement. I'm pretty sure my daily life is not much different from the normal but for
                    what its worth, it is my life. Most of it will contain <span style = "color:purple">sleeping</span>, video games, <span style = "color:brown">food</span>, and
                    maybe, if I'm feeling <b>extra</b> <span style = "color:red">spicy</span>, some thoughts about the concept of life. If what you find is of any interest to you, 
                    you are free to come looking for me somewhere on campus next year when everything opens up again(Hopefully). Although I'm saying this now, unless you know where 
                    I'm going to live next quarter, the chances that you will find me out of my house is pretty low so good luck.

                <h2 id="d1">Day 1</h2>
                <h3>Monday, April 5, 2021</h3>
                <p>This first day was probably the best day of the week for me overall with everything good that happened to me that day. I started the day off perfectly with a good
                    nights sleep while still waking up in time to attend my one lecture for the day. This meant that not only was I feeling <i>great</i> when I woke up, I was also 
                    basically done with classes for the day after that first lecture ended. For lunch I had some fantastic left over Nashville Hot Chicken Tenders I had gotten the
                    other day with some friends. On top of all this, monday was also the day that I was supposed to be getting the first dose of my <strong>Covid-19 Vaccine</strong>
                    which I just qualified for. Honestly after the shot, I felt as though I was good enough to do my usual activities so I immediately went into doing some exercises
                    which I kind of regretted later. The only problem for the rest of the day was that my arm became so sore afterwards that I couldn't lift my arm or do anything with
                    it for the next day.

                    <p>Also, just in case you haven't been enlightened on the greatness that is Nashville Hot Chicken Tenders, I'll give you a quick sample below of the feast I had that
                        made my day so great:

                        <p>This is from a food truck that goes around the orange county area where I'm from that sells the chicken shown above. Honestly, compared to places like 
                            Raising Caines and other chicken tenders places, I don't think there's an area that beats this in value and flavor overall.

                <h2 id="d2">Day 2</h2>
                <h3>Tuesday, April 6, 2021</h3>
                <p>This day was overall pretty hectic for the most part seeing that the first thing I woke up to was an immediate family emergency. There was <em>a lot</em> to take care 
                of that day to deal with the family emergency so most of my day was taken up by that sponteneous event. The rest of the day that I had left was spent catching up on
                all of the lectures and assignments I had to do for that day and so I didn't really have a lot of time to myself. The one interesting thing that came out of that day
                was that in another one of my classes, I learned about using matlab to manipulate audio files and for one of the parts, I had to manipulate an audio file I generated
                which, if you're curious, will be below for you to check out. Spoiler: it really is just some filler talk to take up time.<br> Here is the audio clip:</p>

                <h2 id="d3">Day 3</h2>
                <h3>Wednesday, April 7, 2021</h3>
                <p>For me, this is the current day that I am working on this project meaning that overall there is not much to talk about as of this moment. The biggest event of
                    today for me would be the emergency meeting that I had to attend that happened right before I began working on this lab. Other than that this day was just 
                    lectures and homework yet again. As for things that I have planned today, I have to:
                </p>
                <div class = listBox>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Finish this lab.</li>
                        <li>Eat dinner with my family.</li>
                        <li>Get in some exercise or move my body in some way.</li>
                        <li>Get ready for tomorrow's classes.</li>
                        <li>Relax and destress.</li>
                    </ol>
                </div>
                <p>The plan is to hopefully get everything done on time and in this order so that I can go to sleep without having to worry about everything I have to do when I
                    wake up. Also hopefully I can somewhat fix my sleep schedule so I can feel refreshed when I have to wake up for my morning classes in the future.
